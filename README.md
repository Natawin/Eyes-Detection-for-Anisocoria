Project Overview:
This project is aimed at assessing the risk of Anisocoria, a condition where the pupils of the two eyes are unequal in size. Anisocoria can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions that may pose health risks.

Knowledge about Anisocoria
Anisocoria is a condition where the pupils of the two eyes are unequal in size. Normally, a difference in pupil size of less than 1 millimeter is considered normal. However, if the difference exceeds 1 millimeter, it may indicate medical issues such as brain injury, glaucoma, or neurological disorders.

Usage Conditions:
1.If you want to run the code, you need to have the OpenCV module installed first. You can use the following command to install it "pip install opencv-python"
2.The images should have the same aspect ratio.
3.Both images should have a similar zoom level. For example, if you use x1 zoom for the left eye, you should also use x1 zoom for the right eye. Likewise, the distance from the camera should be consistent for both eyes to minimize any discrepancies. The distance between the camera and the left eye should be the same as the distance to the right eye.
